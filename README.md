# Spadium Offline

Spadium Offline is a script that operates within an offline webpage to avoid network traffic, similar to [Spadium Lite](https://github.com/e9x/spadium-lite), and allows websites to be rendered locally without external requests.

## Development

Make sure you're going to "/spadium.html", not "/" or "/index.html".
